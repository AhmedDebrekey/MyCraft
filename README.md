# MyCraft

This is a miniature MineCraft clone made in C++/OpenGL that I have been working on for a couple of weeks.

The file structure is not the best, but after all it is just a small hobby project that I started for my own amusement.

Project status: Not really working on it much since I got busy with school.

//TODO:
- Infinite World Generation
- Collision Detection
- Ray Casting
- More Realistic World Generation (Trees, Water, Sand, Flowers, Better World Generation Noise)

A View Of The World Generation
